## Wild West Basic FPS 

Extremely barebones outline proof of concept was originally made to create a 3D first-person shooter template.
This is a rough demo, the code is also very rough and needs a thorough cleanup.
All environments, weapons, art, and animations are made by myself via pixel art painting / Block bench modeling. Far from complete and desperately in need of a workflow cleanup.

All guns have different sounds, animations, and behavior based on a reusable resource system.
